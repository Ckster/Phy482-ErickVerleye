## Assignment 1

Erick, this is a very timely proposal for a project. I think storing and distributing electrical energy is clearly going to be a major chellenge for us in the future and developing an understanding of supercapacitance helps us meet this challenge. One thing that is very much missing from this proposal are references that you are using to inform your paper. I see two (of four) names that seem like references (CEI and Thai), but neither link to a paper. A couple of review papers that migjt be useful (from my own google serarch and reasing of abstracts) might be:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114008934
and
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775313013256
For Friday, I'd very much like to see a summary of two papers that you are planning to use in your paper. They can be the ones that I proposed or two others that you have found intersting.

* Score 16/20
