# Feedback on Project Work
## Erick Verleye

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 4

Erick, great writeup. I think you did a great job with the feedback last week and worked on connecting up the different papers you have written. I think the notes at the end of this are helfpul as well in terms of letting me know where you are going next. A few things that would be helpful for this paper, is some sort of comparative graph illustrating super capacitors and Li-Ion power delivery differences (you can snag that from a paper and reference it). Additionaly, when you get into the constriuction of super-capacitors, I'd like to see a model of them, i.e., a figure of how they are constructed and references to the figutre to indicate what they look like, how they are constructed etc. As long as you reference where the figures come from, you don't need to make them yourself. For this week, I'd like to see you get this draft closer to the final version both by addressing my concerns and your own. Great work!

## Assignment 3

Erick, again your reviews are well-written and give me a good sense of what you are getting from the papers. The review article on recent developments, in particular, seems like it was helpful in framing the production of activated carbon. It appears that you paper is moving from physical models to chemical and electrical processes for the production of supercapactive materials. That is totally fine, if that's what you are finding interesting. Your assignment for this week will be to take these extensive summaries that you have constructed and synthesize them -- forming the basis for your paper. Because the papers deal with different aspects and discuss different scales of reesarch, you might need to spend some time thinking about how they will fit together; you might also want to read another paper (or source) that helps bridge across the sources that you have presently. Great work so far.

## Assignment 2

Erick, your summaries are well-written and give a good sense of the overview of the articles themselves. I think there's a bit missing from the summaries, which are the details of the models and analysis that's being done in them. I suspect that's because the details might be quite complicated. To make clear what you are studying, I think that you might need to read some paper that describes supercapacitance in more general terms - i.e., how does it come about and what models are used to describe it. Coupling a paper like that to these more detailed studies will help frame the overall paper that you are writing. Think about writing this review as an introduction to the field for someone new. Like I said, the summaries you provided are very good, but I'm asking that you broaden out your search before narrowing again, to make sure that you paper has the necessary background on supercapacitance. Great work.

## Assignment 1

Erick, this is a very timely proposal for a project. I think storing and distributing electrical energy is clearly going to be a major challenge for us in the future and developing an understanding of supercapacitance helps us meet this challenge. One thing that is very much missing from this proposal are references that you are using to inform your paper. I see two (of four) names that seem like references (CEI and Thai), but neither link to a paper. A couple of review papers that might be useful (from my own google search and reading of abstracts) might be:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114008934
and
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775313013256
For Friday, I'd very much like to see a summary of two papers that you are planning to use in your paper. They can be the ones that I proposed or two others that you have found intersting.

* Score 16/20
