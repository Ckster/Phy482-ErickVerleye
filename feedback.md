# Feedback on Project Work
## Erick Verleye

In this file, I will compile your feedback (and grade) for your project homework problems in reverse chronological order. Please do not alter this file and if you do, make sure to add and commit the new version to your repository before turning in the next assignment. Thanks, Danny

## Assignment 2

Erick, your summaries are well-written and give a good sense of the overview of the articles themselves. I think there's a bit missing from the summaries, which are the details of the models and analysis that's being done in them. I suspect that's because the details might be quite complicated. To make clear what you are studying, I think that you might need to read some paper that describes supercapacitance in more general terms - i.e., how does it come about and what models are used to describe it. Coupling a paper like that to these more detailed studies will help frame the overall paper that you are writing. Think about writing this review as an introduction to the field for someone new. Like I said, the summaries you provided are very good, but I'm asking that you broaden out your search before narrowing again, to make sure that you paper has the necessary background on supercapacitance. Great work.

## Assignment 1

Erick, this is a very timely proposal for a project. I think storing and distributing electrical energy is clearly going to be a major challenge for us in the future and developing an understanding of supercapacitance helps us meet this challenge. One thing that is very much missing from this proposal are references that you are using to inform your paper. I see two (of four) names that seem like references (CEI and Thai), but neither link to a paper. A couple of review papers that might be useful (from my own google search and reading of abstracts) might be:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114008934
and
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775313013256
For Friday, I'd very much like to see a summary of two papers that you are planning to use in your paper. They can be the ones that I proposed or two others that you have found intersting.
